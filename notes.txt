do not take the diag but average a few points around it.
pooler les essais du loc et de 1obj pour améliorer la generalization.?

BACK TO V1
c1: windows: .15-.3s for early and .4-.55 for late
v2: windows now .1-.4s for early and .45-.75s for late.
v3: cat10, no reduc dim. All launching all decoding. 
v4: now clipping - baselining - clipping again. All conds, including delay windowing 
v5: reduc dim for single ch decoding + smaller time window
v6: including the presence of a flash in the metadata. Also Decoding cimplexitiy with generalization (sameShape -> sameColor). + mean 3
v7: testing split queries for OVR + better way to arange for split queries aleas. TO BE REPLICATED IN THE NORMAL DECODING
v8: quality threshold = 0.75 (decoding matching in a signle block with perf >.75) -> worse than original.
v9: new Epochs named Epochs_filt with lowpass=30hz, highpass=0.1hz (instead of 0 and 0.01), - Launched both at 13h55 
Finally corrected split_queries for OVR ! to be tested
Corrected test-cond as well, there was a bug due to the change of shape of all_models (not for OVR)
Actually the new epochs is the same as the old, more or less. The sfreq is 50hz, so there is a 25hz lowpass. Only highpass at 0.1hz is different
v10: autoreject + filter with Perf==1 for all - good ! but still "hashy", need to smooth more. Maybe increase sfreq too...
v11: Simple ridgeCV and equalize events for all conds (check for OVR if it works!) + trying complexity regression decoding (with equalize too, maybe try without) + single_channel decoding.
add complexity decoding!
v12: 100hz - still with ridgeCV ! - still equalize_events
v13: 5cat and 11smooth (insread of 21) regression only - WITHOUT equalize_events RELAUNCHED
v14: 10cat regression only - still equalize_events
v15: no cat no mean no equalize events -> best !

no Cmismatch and Smismatch yet + oneobj Perf, Matching and Button, need to relaunch OVR decoding
Generalization of decoders? Using sliding windows
Check the windows of single channels decoding: should it be 1 SOA ?



jobs: 
v13 regression 10mean DONE
v13 regression 5mean DONE
v15 single channel kind mismatch one obj DONE
v15 single ch relation during delay
v13 regression 5cat and smooth11


change Error_type to lower case? Would be great for grepping logs.


Response loc for mismatch??


Use principal angles between subspaces? https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.subspace_angles.html
angle between first and second color (or shape) encoding in scenes ? How is it compared to signle objects?

make ICA separately for each block!!! or not at all...

Binding condition: triangle bleue vs other triangles, generalized to triangle bleue vs other triangles when the other object is blue (and optionally also not a triangle)



Preprocessing notes:
bad subjects (chance-level AUC) : 03 - 09 - 10 - 12 - 14
weird perf before t0: 07 - 11 - 13 - 16

to look into: 
sub01 - very weird looking PSD on 1, 2, 4 and 5, - run4: shity spiked dominating the evoked.
sub02 - run3 (one_obj). Weird very high amplitude ramping.
sub03 - run8 (1obj) : that asshole kept the button pressed for a whole trial. Maybe trials are shifted, resulting in bad decoding perf.
sub06: run1 one response was too quick. Wwird peak in the PSD at ! 12hz and ~30hz. Linked to construction work ? Run5-7-8-9: sustained diverging channels.
sub07 - run5 2obj: delay in one trial, maybe trials are shifted. Also same peak in PSD.
sub08 - run3 2obj: answered once during the presentation of the sentence. same peak in PSD.
sub09: same peak in PSD but even bigger. Huge ammount of noise in frontal sensors. Also looks like there is a jitter on the image presentation, also for sub08 but not really before (maybe on the onset but not the end).
sub10 - same jitter, same peak in PSD, also hige ammount of noise all over. 
sub11 - run1: one press during trial + run4 on during delay. run5: huge jumps + one huge fuckup in the triggers. Trials may be shifted. One button press at the begining of a trial in run6. Super fucking weird channel jumps in run7. On press before image on run 8. Super weird high sustained channels on run 9 + one press during the image. What a clusterfuck!
sub12 - run4 and 7: fckin weird ch jump. run5-6-7: weird peak in the PSD at 55hz... no run 10 ?
sub13 - run1: multiple answers during trials. Weird ch jumps in run7. No run10.
sub14: just fucking noisy all over.
sub15 - run1: button press jsut before a trial. run6: one trial is shifted. 
sub16: bit noisy but looks ok. problem in run8?



Meeting 27-10-20:
Mesure résumée : pool par fenetre après chaque mot et moyenne
La généralisation est-elle "diagonale" après le mot, ou bien off-diagonale ? Si on a un processing très différent on peut s'attendre a du off-diagonale. 
Decoder la position des mots ? Ou bien l'inclure dans la RSA. 
Inclure un flash sur tout l'écran, un truc gris ou salt and pepper, sur la moitié des essais, 500ms avant l'image. -> flash = trigger 5 
Figure finale : on veut un truc a la JR ou a la Pedro avec un timecourse par propriété d'interet: forme1, couleur1, relation, forme2, couleur2, objet individuels, match/nonmatch 
Trace de la prédiction pour chaque décodeur : quand est-ce que la perf est bonne ET quand est-ce qu'on a une réactivation. On peut les moyenner comme on le fait pour l'AUC. 
Quand on a une réactivation, est ce qu'elle est jointe pour nom et adj (forme et couleur), ou bien séparée ? Quel délai ? Comment sont ségrégées les réactivations d'un objet et de l'autre ? => binding problem.
